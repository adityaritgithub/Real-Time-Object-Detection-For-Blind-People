# Real-Time-Object-Detection-For-Blind-People
❖ Developed a Real-Time Object Detection System for visually impaired individuals to navigate their environment independently using , Deep Learning Library, YOLO-v5 Algorithm and Python.
❖ Implemented a YOLO-v5 (You Only Look Once-version 5) Algorithm to Detect Objects in Real-Time Images.
❖ Utilized a Python library (pyttsx3) to convert Detected object text to audio signals.
❖ Aim of this project is to help visually impaired people, with some another application like in Autonomous vehicles and Security & Surveillance.
